# Have you noticed that we offers multiple presets for Progression

# Progression Boost will encode the video multiple times to build a
# polynomial model in order to decide on the `--crf` used.
# Specify the `--crf` the test encodes will run at in each pass. The
# number of `--crf`s in this list also decides the number of test
# encodes to perform.
#
# For boosting using SSIMU2 metric using most of the common methods of
# estimating final `--crf`, it's very beneficial to run at least 4
# encode passes. Running 3 passes will only shorten the runtime by one
# fourth, while damaging the consistency of final encode by a huge
# margin. It shouldn't be preferred, unless the main encoding pass is
# also performed at a relatively high `--preset`.
# 
# Also, if you're wondering why the `--crf` values go so high to 40 and
# 50, the answer is that even at 40 or 50, some, especially still,
# scenes can still achieve amazing results with 90+ SSIMU2 mean.

# relation between `--crf` and Butteraugli 3Norm score in
# `--crf [10 ~ 30]` range. This is both a blessing and a curse. The
# blessing is that we can create a good linear model with only two test
# encode passes. The curse is that we're unable to build a good model
# extending to beyond `--crf 30`, which closes the door to encodes
# targeting lower quality targets. Comment the lines above and

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the grand scheme of scene detection, av1an is the more universal
# option for scene detection. It works well in most conditions.
#
# Depending on the situations, you may want to use
# `--sc-method standard` or `--sc-method fast`.
#
# The reason `--sc-method fast` is sometimes preferred over
# `--sc-method standard` is that `--sc-method standard` will sometimes
# place scenecut not at the actual frame the scene changes, but at a
# frame optimised for encoder to reuse information.
# `--sc-method fast` is preferred because, first, the benefit from this
# optimisation is insignificant for most sources, and second, it means
# Progression Boost (or any other boosting scripts) will be much less
# accurate as a result, since scenes with such optimisation can contain
# frames from nearby scenes, which said frames will then certainly be
# overboosted or underboosted.
#
# However, in sections that's challenging for scene detection, such as
# a continous cut many times the length of
# `scene_detection_extra_split` featuring lots of movements but no
# actual scenecuts, or sections with a lot of very fancy transition
# effects between cuts, `--sc-method standard` should be always
# preferred. The aforementioned additional optimisations are very
# helpful in complex sections and `--sc-method standard` greatly
# outperforms `--sc-method fast` in sources with such sections.
#
# You should use `--sc-method standard` if you anime contains sections
# challenging for scene detection such as what's mentioned above.
# Otherwise, `--sc-method fast` or WWXD or SCXVID based detection
# introduced below should always be preferred.
# 
# If you want to use av1an for scene detection, specify the av1an
# parameters. You need to specify all parameters for an `--sc-only`
# pass other than `-i`, `--temp` and `--scenes`.
# scene_detection_method = "av1an".lower()
# scene_detection_parameters = f"--sc-method fast --chunk-method lsmash"
# Below are the parameters that should always be used. Regular users
# would not need to modify these.

# av1an is mostly good, except for one single problem: av1an often
# prefers to place the keyframe at the start of a series of still,
# unmoving frames. This preference even takes priority over placing
# keyframes at actual scene changes. For most works, it's common to
# find cuts where the character will make some movements at the very
# start of a cut, before they settles and starts talking. Using av1an,
# these few frames will be allocated to the previous scenes. These are
# a low number of frames, with movements, and after an actual scene
# changes, but placed at the very end of previous scene, which is why
# they will often be encoded badly. They most likely would be picked up
# by Progression Boost to be given a big boost, but compared to av1an,
# WWXD or Scxvid is more reliable in this matter, and would have less
# potentials for issues like this.
#
# Similar to `--sc-method fast` against `--sc-method standard`, WWXD
# and Scxvid struggles in sections challenging for scene detection,
# such as a continous cut many times the length of
# `scene_detection_extra_split` featuring lots of movements but no
# actual scenecuts, or sections with a lot of very fancy transition
# effects between cuts. WWXD or Scxvid tends to mark either too much or
# too few keyframes. Although this is largely alleviated by the
# additional scene detection logic in this script, you should prefer
# `--sc-method standard` if your source contains long sections of very
# challenging material unless you're boosting the worst frames to be
# good.
#
# In general, you should always use WWXD or Scxvid if you cares about
# the worst frames. For encodes targeting a good mean quality, if there
# are no sections difficult for scene detection, WWXD or Scxvid is
# preferred over `--sc-method fast`. If there are such sections, as
# explained above when introducing av1an-based scene detection,
# `--sc-method standard` should be preferred.
# 
# Progression Boost provides two options for VapourSynth-based scene
# detection, `wwxd` and `wwxd_scxvid`. `wwxd_scxvid` is slightly safer
# than `wwxd` alone, but multiple times slower. You should use
# `wwxd_scxvid` unless it's too slow, which `wwxd` can be then used. If
# you want to use VapourSynth-based scene detection, comment the lines
# above for av1an, uncomment the first line below for VapourSynth, and
# then uncomment the specific method you want to use for scene
# detection.
#
# Note that if you're encoding videos with full instead of limited
# colour range, you must go down to the code and adjust the threshold.
# Search for „limited“, and there will be a comment there marking how
# you should adjust.

# data later. Keep the number of frames picked here at a modest amount
# if you're using a mean-based method. If you're using a percentile-
# based method to boost the worst frames, you can consider picking half

# prevent random bad frames from slipping through.
# When targeting lower quality targets, a looser observation such as
# observing the 20th or the 30th percentile should also produce a decent
# result.
